# SkyGeni Data Engineer Assignment ‚Äì Client Subscription Insights Analysis

The goal of the Data Engineer assignment was to analyze subscription, industry, payment, and financial data to extract business insights related to client behavior, renewal trends, inflation influence, and payment patterns.

As a beginner in data analysis, I‚Äôve completed this assignment using Python and Jupyter Notebook, with as many comments as possible to explain my approach.
